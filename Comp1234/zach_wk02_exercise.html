    <H2>St. Catharines Ontario</H2>
    <p>While St Catharines is not the prettiest city, it has a lot of things that are important to me. I have lived here
        my entire life, met my Girlfriend who is now my Fiancee here, completed my Undergrad, started teaching and
        worked in the game industry. This place has alot of meaning to me, and as much as I want to leave, I do love it
